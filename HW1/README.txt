Design Implementation


Walkthrough 2) 

The original Van Gogh image was separated into three channels and corresponding images were created for the three channels.
Finally, a collage was created using the original image and the three images from the respective channels.


Walkthrough 3)

The Manhattan image was resized to have a height of 500 pixels. 

The I_Love_New_York image was converted from color to grayscale to binary mask. 
The binary mask was resized to have a height of 400 pixels and was then inverted.
The mask was then resized by adding to padding to all sides for it to have the same dimensions as the Manhattan image.

The I love New York logo was then burnt on the Manhattan scene.
